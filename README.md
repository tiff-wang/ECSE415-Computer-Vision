This repos holds all of my up-to-date ECSE 415 assignments. I don't mind if you use them as a reference. However, I would really appreciate it if you can give the repos a *star*. Thanks! 

This class goes over basic feature extraction methods (sharpening, denoising, SIFT, SURF, etc.), template matching, image stitching methodologies that are important in computer vision. 

These assignments are written in Python and uses different libraries. Once you have `pip` installed, you can install all the dependencies of using the following command: 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
